as some notes used in RIT course CSCI605's recitation
sessions.

### Threads 1: Possible scheduling scenarios
- WhichOutput.java
- How to force specific output orders:
  00 / 01 / 10(possible?) / 11 / 12 / 21 (possible?) / 22
- Is 20 possible?
- How to do the same using join()?

### Threads 2: Possible scheduling scenarios
- WhichOrder.java
- Can we force it to be executed in the order the arguments were passed? How
  to do it with sleep methods?
- What if we use join methods, can we force it to be sequential?
- How to make it in descending order with sleep?
- What about with join?
